# CLI 2022 FRC Game Quiz
I wrote this project to prepare myself for the FIT Waco Districts, where I will be serving as referee. Wish me luck.

## Explanation
The questions that are asked pertain to match play and competition. None of the rules related to robot design are included. The quiz presents the rule and asks you to recall the penalties associated with breaking the rules.

	42 / 59
	Rule G403 - 2 cargo max
	Robot may not have greater than momentary control of 3 cargo at a time
	Answer: foul/cargo
	âœ– Incorrect!
	The correct answer is "FOUL/CARGO,YELLOW CARD"

## Usage
If you want to use this program to teach yourself the rules, clone this repo and run the following commands

	git clone git@github.com:josephnormandev/frc2022-rules.git
	cd frc2022-rules
	npm i
	npm start

From there you will be asked to complete the 59 question exam. Upon completion, the program will tell you which rules to review (you got wrong). It will be fairly difficult starting off, but I'm sure repeatedly taking this quiz will get you to 100%.
